I came across this data set thanks to Jeremy Singer-Vine's "Data is Plural" blog. (https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural)

I had two goals: to test which variables, if any, were correlated (e.g. wealth & variety of diet) and to visualize geographic data.

The Tesco Grocery 1.0 dataset is a record of 420M food items purchased by 1.6M fidelity card owners who shopped at the 411 Tesco stores in Greater London over the course of the entire year of 2015, aggregated at the level of census areas to preserve anonymity. For each area, we report the number of transactions and nutritional properties of the typical food item bought including the average caloric intake and the composition of nutrients. The set of global trade international numbers (barcodes) for each food type is also included.
